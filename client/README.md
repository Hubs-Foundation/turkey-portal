This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Make sure database server is running. See Read me in root project.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Path Alias

To add or edit the import path aliases refer to [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/mozilla/turkey-portal/blob/main/client/tsconfig.json). Remember to update storybook in file [main.js](https://github.com/mozilla/turkey-portal/blob/main/client/.storybook/main.js) in parallel to match the file paths.
